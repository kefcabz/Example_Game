Wii Tank Minigame ðŸŽ®
Overview

This project is a simple 3D tank minigame inspired by Wii Playâ€™s Tanks!, created as part of my Game Design Workshop course at Fitchburg State University.

Players control a cube-based tank inside an arena, navigating obstacles, dodging enemy fire, and trying to destroy AI-controlled enemy tanks.

The goal is to experiment with core gameplay mechanics such as movement, shooting, collisions, and basic AI behaviors while keeping the scope small and manageable.
